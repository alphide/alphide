Hi, I'm Alphide! (Jonathan)
I'm interested and wanting to learn ML/ML algorithms (anything AI related is cool also)
I'm proficient with Java and Python and familiar with Lua and JSâ€”dabbled in react
I like to spend my free time gaming, working on cool side projects or Roblox stuff, going to the gym, and hanging out with friends!
